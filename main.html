                <p> Hello my name is Josh, I am a third year computing student at UEA. The research gathered will be used to develop my third year project. 
                    The supervisors for the research are Saber Sami and Michal Mackiewicz. The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of using 
                    games to help treat cognition-based illnesses such as dementia and Alzheimerâ€™s. 
                </p>
        
        
                <p> To determine this, you will be asked to complete a variety of "serious" games, eyetracking data and scores will be taken to evaluate how 
                    effective the games are at giving insight on cognitive ability. Eyetracking data will be conglomerated into a software, which will then 
                    be used as reference to determine engagement of the participant with the games, while scores will be taken to determine basic cognitive 
                    ability as well as determine how useful the game is. If there are any concerns about the study, research or data collection please do not hesitate 
                    to contact either me, or my supervisors on the details listed below. Though many of your questions may be answered in the "Participant_Information.docx"
                    document, made avalible to you upon completing the signup process and must be filled-in and emailed back to either me, the lead researcher or either supervisor 
                    before participation.
                </p>
